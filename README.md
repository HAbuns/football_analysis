# Football Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on football analysis, utilizing YOLO (You Only Look Once) for player detection and ByteTrack for tracking player movements on the field. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from Roboflow, which includes various football match scenarios. The primary goal is to detect players in real-time and calculate ball possession statistics.

## Features

- **Player Detection**: Using YOLO for accurate real-time player identification.
- **Player Tracking**: Implementing ByteTrack to follow player movements across the field.
- **Ball Possession Calculation**: Determining the control of the ball based on player movements.

## Tools and Technologies

- **YOLO**: A state-of-the-art object detection algorithm used for real-time football player detection.
- **ByteTrack**: A tracking algorithm that ensures continuous player identification throughout the match.
- **Roboflow**: Dataset provider for training the model with various football match footage.
